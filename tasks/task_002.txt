1. Choose between npm or yarn as the package manager (yarn offers better performance and deterministic installations)
2. Initialize the project with `npm init` or `yarn init` using the `-y` flag for default settings
3. Configure package.json with project metadata (name, version, description, author, license)
4. Add initial dependencies categorized as dependencies and devDependencies
5. Set up common npm scripts for development workflow (start, build, test)
6. Configure npm/yarn to use a specific version range strategy (e.g., using ^ or ~ for version ranges)
7. Add a .npmrc or .yarnrc file for team-wide package manager configurations
8. Test the configuration by installing dependencies and running a basic script

Great progress on the initialization! Here's additional information to add:

For package.json configuration:
- Added "type": "module" to support ES modules syntax
- Set "engines": { "node": ">=18.0.0" } to ensure compatibility with Next.js requirements
- Added "browserslist" configuration for proper transpilation targets

For dependencies:
- Installed ESLint and Prettier dev dependencies with Next.js recommended configs
- Added TypeScript support with @types/react and @types/react-dom
- Configured Jest with testing-library for component testing

Additional configurations:
- Created .nvmrc file with "18" to standardize Node.js version across team
- Added .gitignore with appropriate patterns for Next.js projects
- Set up VSCode settings.json with recommended extensions for the project

Verified the setup by running `npm run dev` successfully and confirming hot reloading works.

## 2. Configure Code Quality Tools (ESLint and Prettier) [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Set up and configure ESLint for code linting and Prettier for code formatting with appropriate rules and plugins
### Details:
1. Install ESLint and Prettier as dev dependencies: `npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier`
2. Create ESLint configuration file (.eslintrc.js or .eslintrc.json) with appropriate rules for the project
3. Configure Prettier with a .prettierrc file defining code style rules (indentation, quotes, semicolons, etc.)
4. Set up ESLint-Prettier integration to avoid conflicts between the two tools
5. Add lint and format scripts to package.json: `"lint": "eslint . --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx"` and `"format": "prettier --write '**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,css,md}'`
6. Create .eslintignore and .prettierignore files to exclude build artifacts, node_modules, etc.
7. Configure VS Code settings (settings.json) for ESLint and Prettier integration
8. Test the setup by running lint and format commands on sample files

<info added on 2025-05-08T06:25:38.653Z>
Here's the additional information to add:

For .eslintrc.json, consider these specific rules for Next.js projects:
```json
{
  "extends": ["next/core-web-vitals", "plugin:prettier/recommended"],
  "rules": {
    "react/react-in-jsx-scope": "off",
    "react/prop-types": "off",
    "no-unused-vars": ["error", { "argsIgnorePattern": "^_", "varsIgnorePattern": "^_" }],
    "import/order": ["error", {
      "groups": ["builtin", "external", "internal", "parent", "sibling", "index"],
      "newlines-between": "always",
      "alphabetize": { "order": "asc", "caseInsensitive": true }
    }]
  }
}
```

For .prettierrc.json, these are the specific values used:
```json
{
  "semi": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "singleQuote": true,
  "printWidth": 100,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "useTabs": false,
  "endOfLine": "lf"
}
```

The .vscode/settings.json configuration includes:
```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  },
  "eslint.validate": ["javascript", "javascriptreact", "typescript", "typescriptreact"]
}
```

Added husky and lint-staged for pre-commit hooks:
```bash
npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged
npx husky install
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx lint-staged"
```

With this lint-staged configuration in package.json:
```json
"lint-staged": {
  "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
  "*.{json,css,md}": ["prettier --write"]
}
```
</info added on 2025-05-08T06:25:38.653Z>

## 3. Implement Git Hooks and Commit Standards [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Set up Git hooks using Husky and lint-staged to enforce code quality standards and consistent commit messages
### Details:
1. Install Husky and lint-staged: `npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged commitlint @commitlint/config-conventional`
2. Configure Husky in package.json or through a dedicated .husky directory
3. Set up pre-commit hooks to run linting and formatting on staged files
4. Configure lint-staged in package.json to run ESLint and Prettier only on changed files
5. Set up commitlint with conventional commit standards
6. Add a commit-msg hook to validate commit message format
7. Create a .commitlintrc.js file with rules for commit message format
8. Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file documenting the commit message format and workflow
9. Test the Git hooks by making sample commits with both valid and invalid formats

<info added on 2025-05-08T06:29:52.435Z>
**Implementation Details:**

- Husky initialization command used: `npx husky install`
- Added prepare script to package.json: `"prepare": "husky install"`
- Pre-commit hook content:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/sh
  . "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"
  
  npx lint-staged
  ```
- Lint-staged configuration in package.json:
  ```json
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "prettier --write"
    ],
    "*.{json,css,md}": [
      "prettier --write"
    ]
  }
  ```
- Commit-msg hook content:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/sh
  . "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"
  
  npx --no -- commitlint --edit $1
  ```
- .commitlintrc.json content:
  ```json
  {
    "extends": ["@commitlint/config-conventional"],
    "rules": {
      "body-max-line-length": [2, "always", 100]
    }
  }
  ```
- Added commit message examples to CONTRIBUTING.md:
  ```
  feat: add user authentication
  fix: resolve issue with API response handling
  docs: update installation instructions
  style: format code according to style guide
  refactor: simplify data processing logic
  test: add unit tests for user service
  chore: update dependencies
  ```
- Verified hooks work by testing with invalid commit message format

<info added on 2025-05-09T14:22:18.435Z>
**Debugging Husky Hook Execution:**

- The "husky.sh not found" error typically occurs when Husky wasn't properly initialized or the Git hooks weren't installed correctly
- Fix steps:
  1. Verify Husky installation: `npm ls husky`
  2. Reinstall Husky with: `npm uninstall husky && npm install --save-dev husky`
  3. Manually initialize: `npx husky install`
  4. Check permissions on .husky directory: `chmod +x .husky/*`

- Alternative hook setup using package.json scripts:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "precommit": "lint-staged",
    "commitmsg": "commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"
  }
  ```

- Added Git global hooks configuration:
  ```bash
  git config --global core.hooksPath .husky
  ```

- Created troubleshooting section in CONTRIBUTING.md with common hook issues and solutions
- Added a bypass note explaining when `--no-verify` is appropriate (emergency fixes only)
- Implemented a CI check to ensure commits follow conventions even if local hooks are bypassed

<info added on 2025-05-10T00:13:14.179Z>
**Implementation Update:**

- Updated to Husky v9 configuration:
  ```bash
  npx husky init
  ```
- Created .husky/pre-commit with Husky v9 syntax:
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env sh
  . "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

  npx lint-staged
  ```
- Created .husky/commit-msg with Husky v9 syntax:
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env sh
  . "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

  npx --no -- commitlint --edit "$1"
  ```
- Made hook scripts executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x .husky/pre-commit .husky/commit-msg
  ```
- Verified hook execution with test commits:
  - Pre-commit successfully ran ESLint and Prettier on staged files
  - Commit-msg successfully validated conventional commit format
- Added all hook configurations to develop branch with:
  ```bash
  git add .husky/ package.json .commitlintrc.json
  git commit -m "chore: configure git hooks with husky v9"
  git push origin develop
  ```
- Confirmed hooks are properly triggered for all team members after pulling from develop

<info added on 2025-05-10T00:21:48.044Z>
For the README.md section:

```md
## Getting Started

### Development Server
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
The development server will be available at http://localhost:4000

### Code Quality Tools
- **ESLint**: Enforces code quality standards
  - Run: `npm run lint`
  - Configuration: `.eslintrc.js`
- **Prettier**: Ensures consistent code formatting
  - Run: `npm run format`
  - Configuration: `.prettierrc`

### Git Workflow
- **Husky**: Manages Git hooks
- **lint-staged**: Runs linters on staged files
- **commitlint**: Enforces Conventional Commits format
  - Format: `type(scope): message` (e.g., `feat(auth): add login functionality`)

### Docker
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t project-name .

# Run the container
docker run -p 4000:4000 project-name
```
```

For the CONTRIBUTING.md section:

```md
## Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- Feature branches: Created from `develop`, merged back via pull requests

## Commit Standards
We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard:
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting changes
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc.

Commits not following this convention will be rejected by commitlint.

## Pre-commit Hooks
- All staged files are automatically linted and formatted before commits
- Failed linting will prevent commits until issues are resolved
```
