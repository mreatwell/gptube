# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Repository Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize project repository with basic structure and configuration files
# Details:
Create a new repository, set up version control, add README.md with project overview, configure .gitignore for the appropriate tech stack, and establish branch protection rules for main/master branch

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository accessibility, confirm proper structure, and ensure all team members have appropriate access

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Git Repository with Basic Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Git repository with a well-organized directory structure following modular design patterns and separation of concerns.
### Details:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. Clone the repository locally
3. Create the following directory structure:
   - src/ (for source code)
   - docs/ (for documentation)
   - tests/ (for unit and integration tests)
   - config/ (for configuration files)
4. Add a basic README.md with sections for:
   - Project title and description
   - Setup instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Contributing guidelines
   - License information
5. Make initial commit with this structure
6. Push to remote repository

Testing approach: Verify that all directories are created correctly and README.md is properly formatted by checking the repository on the hosting platform.

Based on your completed setup, here's additional information to enhance the subtask:

For the directory structure, consider adding these subdirectories for better organization:
- src/api/ (for API endpoints)
- src/services/ (for business logic)
- src/models/ (for data models)
- src/utils/ (for helper functions)
- tests/unit/ and tests/integration/ (separated test types)
- config/dev.env and config/prod.env (environment-specific configs)

Add a .gitignore file with common exclusions for your tech stack (node_modules/, .env files, etc.)

Consider implementing:
- package.json with initial dependencies if using Node.js
- A basic linting configuration (.eslintrc.js)
- GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/ci.yml) for basic CI
- CONTRIBUTING.md with detailed contribution guidelines
- LICENSE file with appropriate open source license

For the README, enhance with:
- Installation prerequisites section
- API documentation section placeholder
- Development workflow instructions
- Screenshots/mockups placeholder section

## 2. Configure .gitignore and Git Attributes [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up proper Git configuration files to exclude unnecessary files from version control and manage file attributes.
### Details:
1. Create a comprehensive .gitignore file appropriate for your tech stack:
   - Use gitignore.io to generate a base template for your languages/frameworks
   - Add common patterns for:
     - Build artifacts and compiled code
     - Dependency directories (node_modules, vendor, etc.)
     - Environment files (.env, .env.local)
     - IDE configuration files (.idea/, .vscode/)
     - Log files and temporary files
2. Create a .gitattributes file to:
   - Set line ending normalization (text=auto)
   - Define binary files (*.png binary)
   - Set merge strategies for commonly conflicting files
3. Test the .gitignore by creating sample files that should be ignored
4. Commit and push these configuration files

Testing approach: Create sample files that should be ignored (like node_modules/ or .env) and verify they don't appear in 'git status' output.

## 3. Implement Branch Protection Rules [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Configure branch protection rules for the main/master branch to ensure code quality and prevent accidental changes.
### Details:
1. Navigate to repository settings on your hosting platform
2. Set up branch protection rules for main/master branch:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require at least one approval before merging
   - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   - Require status checks to pass before merging (if CI/CD is set up)
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Do not allow bypassing the above settings
3. Document these protection rules in the README.md
4. Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file explaining the branch workflow:
   - Feature branch naming convention (e.g., feature/feature-name)
   - Commit message guidelines
   - Pull request process
5. Test the protection by attempting to push directly to the protected branch

Testing approach: Attempt to push directly to the main/master branch and verify it's rejected; create a test PR and verify it requires reviews before merging.

## 4. Set Up Basic CI/CD Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Implement a basic continuous integration pipeline to automate testing and validation of code changes.
### Details:
1. Choose a CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, etc.)
2. Create configuration file(s) in the appropriate location:
   - For GitHub Actions: .github/workflows/ci.yml
   - For GitLab CI: .gitlab-ci.yml
   - For CircleCI: .circleci/config.yml
3. Configure basic CI pipeline with the following stages:
   - Lint: Check code formatting and style
   - Build: Compile or build the project
   - Test: Run unit tests
4. Set up notifications for pipeline failures
5. Document the CI/CD process in the README.md
6. Test the pipeline by making a small change and creating a pull request

Testing approach: Make a small change, push it to a feature branch, create a PR, and verify the CI pipeline runs automatically and performs all configured checks.

## 5. Create Project Configuration Templates [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4
### Description: Add configuration templates and environment-specific configuration files to support different deployment environments.
### Details:
1. Create configuration templates for different environments:
   - Create config/template.env with all required environment variables
   - Add config/example.env with sample values (safe to commit)
   - Document that .env files should never be committed (already in .gitignore)
2. If using infrastructure as code:
   - Add terraform/ or cloudformation/ directory
   - Create environment-specific variable files (dev.tfvars, prod.tfvars)
   - Add a basic infrastructure setup script
3. For containerized applications:
   - Add Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
   - Configure multi-stage builds for development and production
4. Create a setup script (setup.sh or setup.ps1) to:
   - Check for required dependencies
   - Initialize configuration files from templates
   - Set up pre-commit hooks (optional)
5. Update README.md with detailed setup instructions

Testing approach: Run the setup script on a clean environment and verify it correctly initializes all configuration files and prepares the project for development.
