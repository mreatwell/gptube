# Task ID: 3
# Title: Database Schema Design
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and document the database schema for the application
# Details:
Define data models, relationships, constraints, and indexes for Firestore collections. The `processed_videos` collection has been implemented with Document ID = YouTube Video ID and fields including `youtubeUrl`, `transcriptOriginal`, `summaryAI`, `stepsAI`, `clarificationsAI`, `processedAt`, `status`, and `errorMessage`. Documentation has been created in `docs/firestore-schema.md` outlining the current schema and future considerations. Continue to refine and expand the schema as needed for additional collections.

Review schema design with team members to ensure it meets all data requirements and follows best practices. Validate the implemented Firestore schema against actual application requirements.
