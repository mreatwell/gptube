# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement User Feedback System with Status Indicators for GPTube MVP
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive feedback system that provides users with clear status indicators and notifications for all asynchronous operations and user actions within the GPTube application.
# Details:
Develop a unified feedback system with three key components:

1. Loading/Processing Indicators:
- Implement a consistent loading indicator system for all asynchronous operations (API fetches, AI processing, etc.)
- Create skeleton loaders for content areas during initial loads
- Add progress indicators for operations with known duration (uploads, long AI processes)
- Ensure indicators are visible but non-intrusive, following mobile-first principles
- Implement reduced motion alternatives for accessibility compliance

2. Error/Success Messaging:
- Design a toast notification system for temporary messages
- Create inline error states for form fields and interactive elements
- Implement persistent error messages for critical failures
- Ensure all error messages provide clear guidance on how to resolve issues
- Use appropriate color coding (with accessible contrast ratios) and icons
- Include error codes where applicable for troubleshooting
- Make all messages screen-reader friendly with appropriate ARIA attributes

3. Copy/Export Action Feedback:
- Add visual confirmation when content is copied to clipboard
- Provide download/export progress and completion notifications
- Include fallback mechanisms for browsers without clipboard API support

Technical Requirements:
- Use React context to manage global feedback state
- Implement with performance in mind (avoid unnecessary re-renders)
- Ensure all components work across mobile, tablet and desktop viewports
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards for all feedback elements
- Add appropriate data-testid attributes for testing

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover all aspects of the feedback system:

1. Unit Tests:
- Verify loading indicators appear and disappear at appropriate times
- Test error message rendering with various error conditions
- Confirm success messages display correctly
- Validate accessibility properties of all feedback components

2. Integration Tests:
- Test the complete flow of operations that trigger feedback (e.g., form submission → loading → success/error)
- Verify clipboard operations show appropriate feedback
- Test error handling for network failures, server errors, and validation issues

3. Accessibility Testing:
- Use automated tools (Axe, Lighthouse) to verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Test with screen readers to ensure all feedback is properly announced
- Verify keyboard navigation works for dismissing messages

4. Visual Regression Testing:
- Capture screenshots of various feedback states for comparison in future updates
- Test on multiple viewport sizes to verify mobile-first implementation

5. Performance Testing:
- Measure impact of feedback system on overall application performance
- Verify no memory leaks occur with repeated feedback events

6. User Testing:
- Conduct user tests to ensure feedback is clear and helpful
- Verify users understand how to recover from error states

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Loading/Processing Indicator System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a consistent loading indicator system for all asynchronous operations with skeleton loaders, progress indicators, and accessibility features.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a React context (FeedbackContext) with provider to manage global loading states
2. Develop reusable components:
   - Spinner component for general loading states
   - Skeleton loader components for content areas (cards, text blocks, etc.)
   - Progress bar component for operations with known duration
3. Implement hooks for managing loading states:
   - useLoading hook to toggle loading states
   - useProgress hook for tracking progress percentage
4. Add reduced motion alternatives using prefers-reduced-motion media query
5. Ensure all components are responsive following mobile-first principles
6. Add appropriate ARIA attributes and roles for accessibility
7. Implement performance optimizations (useMemo, useCallback) to prevent re-renders

Testing approach:
1. Unit tests for each component with various states
2. Integration tests for context provider behavior
3. Accessibility testing with screen readers
4. Visual regression tests across different viewport sizes
5. Performance testing to ensure minimal impact on application speed

## 2. Develop Error/Success Messaging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Design and implement a comprehensive notification system with toast messages, inline errors, and persistent error states with accessibility compliance.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Extend the FeedbackContext to include error and success message management
2. Create toast notification components:
   - Design container for positioning notifications
   - Implement auto-dismissing logic with configurable timeouts
   - Add animation for entry/exit with reduced motion alternatives
3. Develop inline error components for form fields:
   - Error message display below input fields
   - Visual indicators (border color, icons) for error states
   - Focus management for accessibility
4. Implement persistent error message components for critical failures
5. Create utility functions for common error scenarios
6. Ensure proper color contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA) for all states
7. Add error code display and documentation references where applicable
8. Implement proper ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates

Testing approach:
1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Integration tests for error handling flows
3. Accessibility testing for color contrast and screen reader announcements
4. User testing for error message clarity
5. Test error recovery paths and guidance effectiveness

## 3. Implement Copy/Export Action Feedback System [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2
### Description: Add visual confirmation for clipboard operations and download/export progress with appropriate fallbacks for browser compatibility.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Extend FeedbackContext to track copy/export operations
2. Create clipboard utility functions:
   - Implement copy-to-clipboard functionality with modern Clipboard API
   - Add fallback mechanism for browsers without Clipboard API support
   - Create success/error handlers for clipboard operations
3. Develop export/download feedback components:
   - Progress indicator for large downloads
   - Success confirmation for completed downloads
   - Error handling for failed exports
4. Implement visual confirmation components:
   - Temporary overlay or icon change for copied elements
   - Animation for successful actions (with reduced motion alternatives)
5. Add appropriate ARIA announcements for non-visual feedback
6. Ensure all components work across different viewport sizes
7. Add data-testid attributes for all interactive elements

Testing approach:
1. Unit tests for clipboard and export utilities
2. Integration tests for the complete feedback flow
3. Cross-browser testing for compatibility
4. Accessibility testing for keyboard users and screen readers
5. User testing to ensure feedback is clear and helpful
