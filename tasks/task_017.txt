# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Responsive YouTube URL Input Section with Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a user-friendly landing section with a YouTube URL input field, submit functionality, loading states, and error handling for the gptube MVP.
# Details:
Develop a responsive input section that serves as the primary entry point for the application. The implementation should include:

1. A prominent input field that:
   - Is optimized for both desktop and mobile views (mobile-first approach)
   - Has clear placeholder text (e.g., 'Paste YouTube URL here')
   - Automatically receives focus when the page loads
   - Has appropriate input type and validation attributes
   - Maintains proper contrast ratios for accessibility

2. A visually distinct submit button that:
   - Uses the application's primary color scheme
   - Has appropriate hover/focus states
   - Contains clear action text (e.g., 'Analyze' or 'Summarize')
   - Is properly sized for touch targets on mobile

3. Form submission handling that:
   - Processes the form when Enter key is pressed
   - Shows a non-blocking loading indicator during API calls
   - Clears previous results when a new submission begins
   - Prevents multiple submissions while processing

4. Error handling that:
   - Validates input for YouTube URL format
   - Displays user-friendly error messages
   - Handles API errors gracefully
   - Provides recovery suggestions when appropriate

Ensure all elements have proper ARIA attributes for screen readers and keyboard navigation. The component should be built with performance in mind, avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify functionality, accessibility, and responsiveness:

1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify the input field receives autofocus on page load
   - Test form submission via both button click and Enter key press
   - Confirm loading indicator appears during processing and disappears after completion
   - Validate that previous results are cleared on new submission
   - Test URL validation with various inputs: valid YouTube URLs, invalid URLs, empty input
   - Verify error messages display correctly for different error scenarios
   - Confirm multiple rapid submissions are handled properly

2. Accessibility Testing:
   - Run automated tests with tools like Axe or Lighthouse
   - Verify keyboard navigation works correctly (tab order, focus states)
   - Test with screen readers to ensure all elements are properly announced
   - Check color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
   - Verify error messages are associated with the input field for screen readers

3. Responsive Testing:
   - Test on multiple device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Verify the input field and button are appropriately sized on touch devices
   - Check that the layout adjusts properly at different breakpoints
   - Test on both iOS and Android mobile browsers

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and verify minimal component render time
   - Check for any layout shifts during loading states
   - Verify smooth transitions between states
