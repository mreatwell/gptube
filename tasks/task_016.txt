# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Transcript & AI Features Section
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the transcript and AI features section of the gptube MVP, including a scrollable transcript area with toggle functionality and a prominently displayed summary with copy functionality.
# Details:
Create a responsive and accessible section for displaying the video transcript and AI-generated summary with the following components:

1. Transcript Display:
   - Implement a scrollable container for the transcript text with appropriate height constraints
   - Apply styling for optimal readability (font size, line height, spacing, background color)
   - Ensure the transcript text is selectable and copyable by users
   - Add a show/hide toggle button with appropriate icon and label
   - Implement smooth animation for collapsing/expanding the transcript
   - Handle empty or missing transcript gracefully with appropriate messaging

2. Summary Display:
   - Create a visually distinct card or highlight box for the AI-generated summary
   - Apply styling to make the summary stand out from the transcript (borders, background, etc.)
   - Ensure the summary is properly formatted with paragraphs preserved
   - Implement responsive design for the summary box (adapts to mobile screens)

3. Copy Functionality:
   - Add a copy-to-clipboard button for the summary with appropriate icon
   - Implement the copy functionality using the Clipboard API
   - Provide visual feedback when copy is successful (button state change, toast notification)
   - Handle copy failures gracefully with error messaging

Ensure all elements follow accessibility best practices including proper contrast, focus states, and ARIA attributes. The design should be mobile-first, with appropriate styling for different screen sizes.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both functionality and user experience across devices:

1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify transcript displays correctly with proper formatting
   - Test show/hide toggle functionality works as expected
   - Confirm transcript text is selectable and copyable
   - Verify summary displays correctly in its highlight box
   - Test copy-to-clipboard functionality for the summary
   - Verify copy success feedback is displayed
   - Test error handling for copy failures
   - Verify graceful handling of missing/empty transcript

2. Responsive Testing:
   - Test on multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Verify text remains readable on small screens
   - Confirm scroll behavior works properly on all devices
   - Verify toggle and copy buttons are easily tappable on mobile

3. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Test with screen readers to ensure proper ARIA attributes
   - Check color contrast meets WCAG standards
   - Verify focus states are visible for all interactive elements

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and optimize render time for large transcripts
   - Test scrolling performance with lengthy transcripts
   - Verify copy functionality works efficiently with large text
