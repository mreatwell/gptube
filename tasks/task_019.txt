# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Interactive Q&A Section with User-Friendly Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a responsive Q&A component for the gptube MVP that allows users to ask questions and receive AI-generated answers with appropriate feedback mechanisms.
# Details:
Create a Q&A section with the following components:

1. Question input field:
   - Implement a text input with descriptive placeholder (e.g., 'Ask a question about this video...')
   - Ensure proper sizing and touch target areas for mobile devices
   - Support multiline input with appropriate height constraints
   - Add focus/blur states with accessible styling

2. Ask button:
   - Implement conditional logic to disable the button when input is empty or during loading state
   - Use visual indicators for disabled/enabled states
   - Include appropriate hover/active states
   - Ensure proper spacing from input field

3. Loading indicator:
   - Create a non-intrusive loading animation that appears while waiting for AI response
   - Ensure animation is lightweight and doesn't impact performance
   - Add appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility

4. Answer display:
   - Design a visually distinct container for AI responses
   - Support markdown or rich text formatting if needed
   - Ensure text is properly sized and readable on all devices
   - Implement proper overflow handling for long responses

5. Error handling:
   - Create user-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios
   - Provide retry options when appropriate
   - Ensure errors are descriptive but not technical

6. Copy functionality:
   - Add a copy-to-clipboard button with appropriate icon
   - Implement success/failure feedback for copy action
   - Ensure copied text maintains formatting

All components should follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA), including proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support. Use semantic HTML elements and appropriate ARIA attributes where needed.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover functionality, usability, and edge cases:

1. Functional testing:
   - Verify input field accepts text and properly handles different character lengths
   - Confirm Ask button is disabled when input is empty and during loading
   - Test that loading indicator appears and disappears at appropriate times
   - Verify AI responses display correctly with various content lengths
   - Confirm error messages appear for different error scenarios (network issues, AI service unavailable, etc.)
   - Test copy functionality works across different browsers

2. Responsive testing:
   - Test on multiple device sizes (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px widths)
   - Verify touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile
   - Ensure no horizontal scrolling occurs on small screens
   - Check that text remains readable at all viewport sizes

3. Accessibility testing:
   - Verify all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver) to ensure proper announcements
   - Check color contrast meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text)
   - Verify focus states are visible and clear

4. Performance testing:
   - Measure and optimize component render time
   - Ensure animations don't cause layout shifts
   - Test on low-end devices to verify acceptable performance

5. Edge cases:
   - Test with extremely long questions and answers
   - Verify behavior when network is intermittent
   - Test rapid consecutive question submissions
